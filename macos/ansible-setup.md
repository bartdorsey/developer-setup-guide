# [Ansible] installation

This guide uses [Ansible](https://ansible.com) to automate installation of the
development tools you'll need.

The ansible playbook we've created installs the following tools:

In your Applications folder:

- [Visual Studio Code] - A code editor
- [Postico] - A graphical user interface (GUI) for browsing your PostgreSQL database
- [Postbird] - An alternative open source GUI for Postgres
- [Insomnia] - An application for testing APIs

At the command line:

- [zsh] - If you didn't already have it, your default shell will now be zsh.
- [nvm] - The node version manager, a program to help you manage different node
versions
- [Node.JS] - A JavaScript code runner, we'll be using this to run our JavaScript
- [zip and unzip] - Command line utilities to compress and uncompress zip files.
- [htop] - A nice way to view all the programs running on your computer from the terminal
- [pgcli] - A fancy postgres command line interface
- [starship] - A fancy replacment shell prompt which shows you lots of interesting information about your node version and information about your git repos.

And running as a background program:

- [PostgreSQL] - A database server we'll use to store data for our applications

## Installation of Ansible

So first thing we should do is to install ansible.

We are going to use homebrew to install ansible.

Run this command at the shell prompt.

```sh
brew install ansible
```

Once it has successfully installed, your shell prompt should reappear and you can move on to Running the Ansible Playbook
